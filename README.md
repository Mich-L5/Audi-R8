## About
[This is a website all about the Audi R8](https://michalaforest-audi-r8.netlify.app/). I originally created it for a school project, and decided to continue working on it afterwards and add it to my portfolio. The website has 4 pages:
* ### Home
  The Home page contains general information about the Audi R8, and multiple calls to action.
* ### Product
  The Product page contains specific information and details about the different Audi R8 trims, and multiple calls to action.
* ### About
  The About page contains a brief paragraph about the Audi R8.
* ### Contact
  The Contact page contains a contact form (for design purposes only - it is currently not connected to a server).

> [!NOTE]
> Certain links on the website are external links such as _Buy Today_, _Book a Test Drive_, _Browse Pre-Owned Inventory_, and _Find a Local Dealer_.

## Features
Some of my favorite features of the website are:

### Custom Scrollbar
On desktop screens, the website displays a custom scrollbar throughout the website that has the Audi rings logo as the scrollbar thumb.

### Dynamic Headlights
Upon landing on the Home page, a full-size masthead of the Audi R8 appears. As the user scrolls down, the car's headlights gradually turn on. As the user scrolls back up, the car's headlights gradually turn off.

### Interactive Car Customization
On the Home and Product pages, the user can interact with a customization tool and create their own custom Audi R8 using the following options:
* **Body** (coupe or spyder)
* **Color** (![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png), ![#4b4b4b](https://placehold.co/15x15/4b4b4b/4b4b4b.png), ![#b0b0b0](https://placehold.co/15x15/b0b0b0/b0b0b0.png), ![#ececec](https://placehold.co/15x15/ececec/ececec.png), ![#2e4580](https://placehold.co/15x15/2e4580/2e4580.png), ![#0233ff](https://placehold.co/15x15/0233ff/0233ff.png), ![#f5d502](https://placehold.co/15x15/f5d502/f5d502.png), ![#a40000](https://placehold.co/15x15/a40000/a40000.png))
* **Rims** (black or gold)

### Interactive Car Trim Table 
On the Product page, the user can use a select menu and choose one out of the five Audi R8 trims available. Based on the user's choice, the table underneath is autopopulated with information about the car's specific trim such as the price, engine, fuel economy, horsepower, etc.

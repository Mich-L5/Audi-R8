                    <h3>Audi R8 V8</h3>
                    <small>2007-2012</small>
                    <p>In 2006, Audi introduced the first generation of the R8: a 420HP V8 2-seat
                        all-wheel drive supercar. The car was small, lightweight,
                        and originally available as a coupe (the Spyder model came later in 2008). This first 2007 model
                    was available in both a 6-speed manual transmission and a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                    <p>While very similar to the existing 2007 R8 model, Audi then came out with a V10 version in 2008. With
                    this model, the headlights received an LED system upgrade, along with some chrome accents
                    on the grill frame. Audi also installed a multimedia information display which connected to the Bang & Olufsen sound system.

                    <p>In 2015, Audi introduced the second generation of the Audi R8, which received
                        a completely new look. Audi also got rid of the V8 engine and manual transmission.
                    The sleek new look also featured a high-tech interior, as well as sport-bucket seats.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest changes Audi made in 2017 was introducing a rear-wheel drive R8. Although the car's
                        appearance was very similar to the previous model, it featured some small changes such as a black upper
                        side blade, and an optional red strip that crossed the top of the car.

                        some small appearance changes such as a mate-black singleframe grill.
